## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Our group worked well to bring the full app together. We were able to complete most features we wanted and some stretch goals such as connecting the React frontend to the Express/Postgres backend, finish the main CRUD flows for locations and items, add filtering, and deploy the project on Render. We alos had good communication and we divided tasks clearly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One major challenge was debugging deployment issues, especially with GitHub OAuth and session cookies between the deployed frontend and backend. Features that worked locally needed extra configuration for production, such as environment variables, callback URLs, CORS, and secure cookie settings. Scheduling was also still a challenge because everyone had different availability, so we had to coordinate carefully to finish integration work.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

We are proud that Slice of Life became a full stack app. The app lets users save bakeries and cafes, add details like notes, ratings, tags, and images, filter their bucket list, and manage food or drink items for each location. We are also proud of integrating Google Places so users can search for real places and autofill useful location information.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

We have grown from building smaller isolated features to understanding how a full-stack app fits together. We are more comfortable designing database tables, writing controller logic, creating API routes, connecting those routes to React pages, and handling user interactions to complete a full stack application. We also learned about planning, delegation, and communication when building with a team.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

Our goals are to become better in building full-stack applications. We want to keep improving our skills with authentication, deployment, error handling, responsive design, and API integrations. To achieve this, we plan to keep building projects, practice debugging deployed apps, improve our Git/GitHub workflow, and continue learning best practices for writing clean, maintainable frontend and backend code.
